    <div>
    <p class= "text-centered" >  I am excited to learn more about the field of software engineering. I arrived to software engineering from an interest in buidling my own portfolio as a photographer and filmmaker. When I am not learning to code, I enjoy working in film and photographer as well as exploring the world with my 4 year old daughter. I love to travel and get lost in a new place. The ever changing tech field allows me to discover new things constantly and puts me in unknown places, just like traveling.</p>
